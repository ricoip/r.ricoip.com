# Rico's Web Resources
*r.ricoip.com was previously known as WebResources. As a process of cleaning up my repository names, I have renamed the repository to match the domain name.*

It's the "Discord CDN dilemma" all over again:  
Do I put files that I need to reference in the future (â‰¥ 2 years) into something that may disappear like Imgur, Discord, Pastebin etc. or do I put them somewhere I can control.

The second option won. 

<https://r.ricoip.com> is a place where I put files that need to appear somewhere, but I cannot upload said files to the site itself.

There is nothing for you to see here.
